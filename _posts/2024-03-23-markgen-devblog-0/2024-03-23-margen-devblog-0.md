# Introduction
Good morning/afternoon or evening everyone.

Welcome to my fist devblog for my new project. **MarkGen**.

**MarkGen** is another static-site generator.

For this website I am using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Which is fine for now but after using this. I really wanted something even simpler.

## What is a static-site generator
[Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) for proper explanation.

Well a static-site generator takes input data like templated files and markdown and then converts it to a staiic website, which is a website that doesn't need a backend to run.

## Problem
Making a website with a static-website generator like Jekyll or Gatsby can be rather quite complex and use a couple different tools to get the job done.

What if we only use a [Markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language). To define everything. No HTML or anything (Not required I mean. If you want you can use HTML and CSS)

**NOTE** This project is very early in development but the idea of creating a static-site generator seems really interesting and fun.

# Why
- Because it's fun
- I can learn a thing or two about content generation and optimization.
- It can be a really cool portfolio project
- Wouldn't it be awesome for me to eventually convert this site from Jekyll to my custom static-site generators content

## Potential Features
- Custom Markup language like Markdown but is extended to add custom templating functionality.
- Only Markdown is required. No HTML, CSS
- Can use HTML and CSS if need be.
- A custom theme system that allows users to create themes - like jekyll for other people to use. But it must be easy to use and extend. Cannot be too complicated
- Fast compile times and optimization.
- Support with templating for dynamic elements, variables, conditionals and loops.

# What are you going to do from here
- Firstly plan a bit of the structure of the project and some syntax to show for the next blog.
- Then set up a github repo.
- After setting up the git repo, I can start coding
