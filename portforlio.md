##  Anonymizer
![Title](/assets/img/view.png)
Anonymizer is a AI program that uses computer vision to dectect and blur human faces and number plates in images and videos.
This was for my final year project for CS50

#### Inspirations
- The inspiration for this project came from Google Maps feature.
- [George Hotz's video wokring on a SLAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hlb8YX2-W8)

#### Links
- [Video demo](https://youtu.be/eh73nLzw3pQ)
- [Github src](https://github.com/Aiden-Koorsen/anonymizer)

#### How it works
Well it takes a video or a image as input seen below.
![Before](/assets/img/before.png)

Then the trained AI detects faces and number plates in the image or in each frame in a video.

Then to blur the images, all I do is shrink the image and then scale it back up. This automatically lowers the quality of the image.

Then an output video or image is given like below:
